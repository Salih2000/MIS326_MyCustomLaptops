# MyCustomLaptops
 This project was created as a final project for the MIS 326 Web Programming course. It is a web-based system designed to meet the requirements of the "MyCustomLaptops" case study.

# Requirements
To develop this system, the following requirements were followed:

The .NET Framework or .NEtcore should be used to create web applications.
The front-end code (client-side code) should be developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The back-end code (server-side code) should be developed using C#.
The database schema should be designed to support the requirements
of the platform, and MS SQL Server should be used to design and manage the database.
To connect to the database and perform various operations
such as inserting, updating, deleting, and retrieving data, ADO.NET should be used.
The main functionalities, use cases, and features of the web-based platform are specified in the given case study. The title "Optional Functionalities" is optional and not mandatory.
# Installation and Setup
To run the system locally, you need to install the following:

Microsoft Visual Studio or any other .NETcore development environment
Microsoft SQL Server Express or Developer edition
Web browser
After installing the necessary software, follow these steps to set up the project:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the solution file (MyCustomLaptops.sln) in Visual Studio.
Set up the database by running the SQL scripts located in the "Database" folder.
Configure the connection string in the web.config file to match your local SQL Server instance.
